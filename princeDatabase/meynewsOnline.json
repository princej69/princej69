Things are not final yet.\n\n- Improved app design\n- More settings and stuff\n- Sponsors, don't worry it won't be all across the application.\n\nI have developed another app, called Daily Diary. Currently it only supports adding the diaries, showing the date it was created and the entry. I promise to add more features to both of these apps.\n\nI am also developing a game, based on Laurent Duplaa's Universe Game. Currently only supports one chapter and you can play it locally (download code from github) or online <i>(might not recommend because the full version can use a lot of bandwidth)</>\n\nI transferred to another school and it's gonna start on January 6.",
