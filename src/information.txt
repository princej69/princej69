These are my sources of files that may get used to ../readme.md file.

Have a great day putting these files!
(Do not put without permission)

To get permission from me, do the following:
I.
1. DM me on Twitter @princej69420
2. Message me "(anything), can I have access to this github repository: princej69/princej69"
3. Send another message this time with your GitHub username.

II.
1. DM me on Discord Pink Playz#1655
2. Message me "(anything), can I have access to this github repository: princej69/princej69"
3. Send another message this time with your GitHub username.

Then,
if you're really a programmer, you may create a small project (like numberguessinggame.py) then send me the source code. If it is really working, I will give you permission.
If not, you will do the next method:

Method 2:
watch begula videos-
joke

REAL METHOD 2:
If you're really a programmer, print the hello world 10 times using JavaScript inside the homemade function printl(). If you are not really sure,

Here's the hint:

In JavaScript,
Create a function called printl.
Inside printl() brackets, create an argument called text,
then inside printl() {}, print the text.
Then outside the function,

call printl("hello world") 10 times.

(you have to send me the source code)
If it works, I will give you permission.

If still is not.... I'm sorry... I will have to deny your request...
